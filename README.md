### Project Details:
Predicting stock market trends is a challenging task due to the  noisy nature of financial data. This project leverages the power of LSTMs to capture the temporal dependencies and patterns in stock prices to forecast future trends. The goal is to build a model that can predict the next month open or closing price prediction based on past 10 years of data.
