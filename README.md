# Stock_trend_prediction_using_LSTM

### Project Details:
Predicting stock market trends is a highly challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model using LSTM networks to predict future stock prices based on past performance. The LSTM's ability to capture long-term dependencies in time series data makes it an ideal choice for financial forecastingPredicting stock market trends is a highly challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets.

### Library Used:
Numpy,Pandas,Pandas_DataReader,Matplotlib,Tensorflow,keras,streamlit

### Implemention Phase:
Some of the key steps involve during the implemention of this project are:
1) Install required dependencies.
2) Download Financial data set
3) Perform data preprocessing to clean data and remove noise.
4) Train the Model using LSTM.
5) Evaluate the results by predicting the next 100 days of data based on past data.
6) Visualize the results in graph using streamlit app.
